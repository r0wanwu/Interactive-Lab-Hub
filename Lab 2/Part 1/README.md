Does it feel like time is moving strangely during this semester?

For our first Pi project, we will pay homage to the [timekeeping devices of old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_timekeeping_devices) by making simple clocks.


## Our clock: https://youtu.be/aoxyngLTMCs

This clock displays the time since the beginning of a year, and the time until the next year. 


## Sketch and brainstorm further interactions and features you would like for your clock for Part 2.

1. A clock that shows time depending on the depature and arrivial of ferries in NYC.
