# Lab 2 Part 2

Feedback to our lab2 part 1: 

- I think the idea was cool. But the clock was confusing to read. I didn't really get the change between the two buttons the first time I interacted with the device.

- The displays could be improved, perhaps adding more colors or different font size. It was interesting seeing time being calculated this way.
    

By pressing button 1, the user can see the fruits in season for the specific season he/she is in right now. There is also a time at the top, showing the time until the next season.
