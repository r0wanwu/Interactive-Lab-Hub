# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 14

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 21

Functional check-off - November 28 & 30

Final Project Presentations - December 12

Write-up and documentation due - December 15 

## Objective
For the final project we created a cat food dispenser. It is able to recogize cats, goose, and human. 

 
## Description


## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

## Big Idea

Our interactive device uses image recognition technology to identify cats and geese with a webcam, and dispenses treats for each animal depending on what the system recognizes. We plan to place the device at the Roosevelt Island cat sanctuary to live test it. 

## Timeline

November 14 - Project plan

November 16 - MakerLAB 3D printing training

November 21 - Peer feedback on Project plans

November 28 & 30 - Functional check-off

December 5 & 7 - Final Project Presentations

December 14 - Write-up and documentation due

## Expected Challenges:

- Constructing hardware of food dispenser with 3D printing
- Computer visioning of recognizing animals vs humans

## Parts needed
- Cat and goose photos
- Raspberry Pi
- LED light strip
- Webcam
- 3D printed cat and goose food dispenser
- Water bottle as food container
- Qwiic Servo Controller and Micro Servo Motor SG5


## Fall-back plan
Making changes to the feeder if the feeder is too complicated. We can make it simpler by making cardboard boxes that flip open. 


2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.


3. Documentation of design process

We 

5. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)

7. Video of someone using your project
   
8. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

9. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.
